# Pyraminx 4x4x4 Puzzle GUI

This repository contains a GUI-based simulation for solving a Pyraminx 4x4x4 puzzle, built using Python's `tkinter` framework for the interface and the `PIL` and `OpenCV` libraries for visualizations and move recording.

## Features

- **Interactive Pyraminx Puzzle:** Visual representation of the Pyraminx faces with the ability to shuffle and solve the puzzle.
- **Randomization:** Generate a sequence of random moves to shuffle the puzzle.
- **Puzzle Solver:** An algorithm-based solver that applies moves to reach the solved state.
- **Real-time Animation:** Visualize each rotation with a delay to observe the puzzle's transformation.
- **Move Recording:** Record the moves made on the puzzle in video format.
- **Move Logging:** Track the sequence of moves made to solve or randomize the puzzle.
  
## Requirements

The project requires the following libraries:

- Python 3.x
- `tkinter` for the GUI
- `Pillow` for image manipulation
- `opencv-python` for recording moves to video
- `numpy` for numerical operations
